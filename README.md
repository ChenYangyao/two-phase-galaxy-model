# two-phase-galaxy-model

A two-phase model of galaxy formation presented in the following papers:

- A two-phase model of galaxy formation: I. The growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05030), [ads](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231105030M/abstract)).

## Table of Contents

- Supplementary material for Paper-I: [figures](publications) in the pdf format.

## TODO List

- Code for the model. Documentation and code samples.
- Raw data for figures.
- Catalogs of halo assembly histories and modeled galaxies/SMBHs. 

## Acknowledgements

The empirical model 
[UniverseMachine](https://bitbucket.org/pbehroozi/universemachine/src/main/) for halo-galaxy connection,
and [TRINITY](https://github.com/HaowenZhang/TRINITY) for halo-galaxy-SMBH coevolution,
has inspired our work for model design and implementation. Their comprehensive
collection of observational datasets also helps us for model calibration and
comparison.

Yangyao thanks [Kai Wang](https://www.kosmoswalker.com/) for his enduring 
companionship and support :wink:.
