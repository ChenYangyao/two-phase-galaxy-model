## Acknowledgements

Here we acknowledge the following projects and/or people that helped in the development of 
this code repository. Projects and/or people that are relevant to individual papers
were included in the papers.

Yangyao thanks [Kai Wang](https://www.kosmoswalker.com/) for his enduring 
companionship and support :wink:.

The empirical model 
[UniverseMachine](https://bitbucket.org/pbehroozi/universemachine/src/main/) for halo-galaxy connection,
and [TRINITY](https://github.com/HaowenZhang/TRINITY) for halo-galaxy-SMBH coevolution,
have inspired our work for model design and implementation. Their comprehensive
collection of observational datasets also helps us for model calibration and
comparison.

The SAM of Yingtian Chen, Oleg Y. Gnedin et al. ([source code](https://github.com/ybillchen/GC_formation_model)) 
and the [catalog](https://github.com/ognedin/gc_model_mw) produced by the model have been used for comparison of our model.
